_17/03/25_ - _21/03/25_

Actions:

- Increased the RAM on my Ubuntu VM to 4500 MB.
- Tried installing awscli and Terraform with the apt package manager however this didn't work.
- Tried installing awscli by curling awscli.amazonaws.com > First attempt didn't work as the downloaded file may have corrupted or is incomplete.
- Installed awscli again and it worked.
